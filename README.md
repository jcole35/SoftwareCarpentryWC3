# SoftwareCarpentryWC3
Weekly Challenge 3 for Software Carpentry.
This is an interesting and descriptive README.md for my project here.
This Master branch includes all of the python scripts I was required to make for this weeks challenge.
For part 1 I had to make a "Hello World" script, and for part 2 I had to make a script that added all
of the even numbers for a range between 1 and 100.
