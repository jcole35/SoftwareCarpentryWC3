# SoftwareCarpentryWC3
Weekly Challenge 3 for Software Carpentry.
This is an interesting and descriptive README.md for my project here.
  This Master branch includes all of the python scripts I was required to make for this weeks challenge.
  For part 1 I had to make a "Hello World" script, and for part 2 I had to make a script that added all
  of the even numbers for a range between 1 and 100, and although this description is interesting, the script
  names were required to be mundane.
You can check them out by visiting the repository (link located in the upper right hand corner)
